## 📝 Overview 

<p>
    I'm testing a monstrosity of a game called "Crucible". The idea is that it's a hybrid of Java and Crystal, where 
    Java handles the Launcher & Client and with Crystal powering the Server. This game is meant to be an MMORPG-style 
    game, and example would be <a href="https://runescape.com/">RuneScape</a>. I haven't touched this in a few years, 
    this was back when I was first getting antiquated with Crystal and hadn't touched Java in about 5 years beforehand. 
    As such the Server is working but the Launcher/Client haven't really been worked on, and it's a mess right now but 
    works. It launches a window to verify connected from the Server but that's about it right now. The Server on the 
    other hand is a skeleton, most of the important parts are there and needs to be filled with the right content to 
    actually be a Game.
</p>
<p>
    P.S. The .exe is included, please delete and recompile, doubt it would work on your machine without doing so. I just
    didn't want to delete it because I don't feel like doing that step when I'm testing.
</p>

## ❗ Prerequisites

1. The [Crystal Programming Language](https://crystal-lang.org/install/) installed.
2. Both the [Java Programming Language](https://www.java.com/en/download/) & [Java SE Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/?er=221886) installed. You can get both from just the JDK install.
3. IDE of choice, I used [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
4. Open Project and then be confused.

## 🏁 Getting Started

1. Compile the Server.
2. Compile the Client.
3. Compile the Launcher.
4. Open Project and then be confused.
